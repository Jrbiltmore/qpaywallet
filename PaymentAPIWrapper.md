The `PaymentAPIWrapper.js` module is a JavaScript file that encapsulates the functionality required to interact with various payment platforms through their APIs. It provides an organized and modular approach to making payments, fetching transaction details, and handling errors. Here's a description of the `PaymentAPIWrapper.js` module:

**Module Purpose:**
The purpose of `PaymentAPIWrapper.js` is to simplify and streamline the process of integrating different payment platforms into a single application. It abstracts away the complexities of making API requests, handling responses, and managing errors, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of their application.

**Key Features and Components:**

1. **Class: PaymentAPIWrapper**
   - This class serves as a central point for interacting with payment platforms.
   - It takes a payment platform identifier as a parameter during initialization (e.g., `'visa'` or `'mastercard'`).
   - The class stores the base URL and endpoints specific to the chosen payment platform.

2. **Methods:**
   - **`makePayment(paymentData)`**: This method initiates a payment request to the chosen payment platform using the provided payment data. It handles the entire process of making an API call, including setting headers, sending data, and handling responses.
   - **`getTransaction(transactionId)`**: This method fetches transaction details using the provided transaction ID. It encapsulates the process of making an API call to retrieve transaction information.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The module includes comprehensive error handling for API requests. Any errors encountered during API requests are caught, and informative error messages are generated to aid in debugging.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const PaymentAPIWrapper = require('./PaymentAPIWrapper');

// Initialize PaymentAPIWrapper instances for different payment platforms
const visaAPI = new PaymentAPIWrapper('visa');
const mastercardAPI = new PaymentAPIWrapper('mastercard');

// Example payment data
const paymentData = {
    amount: 100.00,
    currency: 'USD',
    // ... other payment-related data
};

async function processPayments() {
    try {
        // Make payments using the PaymentAPIWrapper instances
        const visaPaymentResult = await visaAPI.makePayment(paymentData);
        const mastercardPaymentResult = await mastercardAPI.makePayment(paymentData);

        // Fetch transaction details
        const visaTransaction = await visaAPI.getTransaction(visaPaymentResult.transactionId);
        const mastercardTransaction = await mastercardAPI.getTransaction(mastercardPaymentResult.transactionId);

        // Additional business logic can be added here

        console.log('Visa Payment Result:', visaPaymentResult);
        console.log('Mastercard Payment Result:', mastercardPaymentResult);
        console.log('Visa Transaction Details:', visaTransaction);
        console.log('Mastercard Transaction Details:', mastercardTransaction);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Payment Error:', error.message);
    }
}

processPayments();
```

**Advantages:**

- **Modularity:** The module encapsulates payment platform interactions, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.
- **Reusability:** The same module can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling ensures that errors are caught and logged appropriately.
- **Abstraction:** Developers can focus on application logic without needing to deal with the intricacies of individual payment platform APIs.

**Considerations:**

- **API Documentation:** The module assumes familiarity with the specific payment platform APIs being integrated. Developers should refer to the official API documentation for accurate implementation.

Remember to tailor the module to match the specific payment platforms you're integrating and adjust any placeholders or generic examples with actual data and logic based on your project's requirements.
